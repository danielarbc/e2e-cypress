# Plugins

## Faker

Generate massive amounts of fake (but realistic) data for testing and development. Webpage: [https://fakerjs.dev/](https://fakerjs.dev/)
I'm using this plugin to fill in data like user, password and address.

## Prettier

An opinionated code formatter. Webpage: [https://prettier.io/](https://prettier.io/)
I'm using this plugin together with the VSCode plugin.
You can configure it as a pre-commit step, but I'm the only one working on this project, so I don't have the necessity.
