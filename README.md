# Portfolio - Showcase with Cypress

This GitHub repository serves as a showcase of my expertise in software testing and quality assurance. Using a fictitious website as the basis, I've developed a comprehensive software testing project powered by Cypress to demonstrate my capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js 18.x
- Node.js 20.x and above

## Installation

To set up the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## How to Run

You can run the tests in two ways. Choose the one that suits your workflow:

### Interactive Mode

To run Cypress in interactive mode and view the test execution in the Cypress Test Runner, use the following command:

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

### Headless Mode

To run Cypress tests in headless mode, which is suitable for automated testing and CI/CD pipelines, use the following command:

```bash
npm run cypress:run
```
